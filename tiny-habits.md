## Question 1

The most interesting story or idea in the Tiny Habits video for me was the concept of "Tiny Habits." BJ Fogg explains that the key to creating new habits is to start incredibly small. Instead of trying to run a mile every day, start by putting on your running shoes. The idea is that by making the habit so small, it's easy to get started and build momentum.

## Question 2

B = MAP is a simple formula for making new habits easier. Here's what each letter stands for:

- **B:** Behavior - the new habit you want to create.
- **M:** Match - make sure the new habit is a match for your motivation and ability.
- **A:** Ability - make the new habit easy to do.
- **P:** Prompt - create a prompt or cue to remind yourself to do the new habit.

## Question 3

Shining or celebrating after each successful completion of a habit is important because it reinforces the behavior and makes it more likely to become a habit. According to BJ Fogg, "Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit." By celebrating, you create a positive association with the new behavior, which makes it more attractive and rewarding.

## Question 4

The most interesting story or idea in the "1% Better Every Day" video for me was the concept of continuous improvement. The idea is that small, consistent improvements can lead to significant progress over time. By focusing on getting 1% better every day, you can achieve your goals without feeling overwhelmed.

## Question 5

In the book "Atomic Habits," the perspective on identity is that your habits reflect your identity. In other words, the person you are today is a result of your habits. By changing your habits, you can change your identity and become the person you want to be. The book emphasizes the importance of creating a clear vision of your ideal self and using that vision to guide your habit-forming efforts.

## Question 6

The book's perspective on making a habit easier to do is to focus on making it more attractive, easier to do, or more satisfying. By making the habit more attractive, you create a positive association with the behavior, which makes it more likely to be repeated. By making the habit easier to do, you reduce the barriers to entry and make it more likely to be performed consistently. By making the habit more satisfying, you reinforce the behavior and make it more rewarding.

## Question 7

The book's perspective on making a habit harder to do is to focus on making it less attractive, harder to do, or less satisfying. By making the habit less attractive, you create a negative association with the behavior, which makes it less likely to be repeated. By making the habit harder to do, you increase the barriers to entry and make it less likely to be performed consistently. By making the habit less satisfying, you reduce the reinforcement and make it less rewarding.

## Question 8

One habit I would like to do more of is meditation. To make the cue obvious, I can set a reminder on my phone to meditate every morning. To make the habit more attractive, I can focus on the benefits of meditation, such as reduced stress and increased focus. To make the habit easier to do, I can start with just a few minutes of meditation each day. To make the response satisfying, I can keep a meditation journal and track my progress over time.

## Question 9

One habit I would like to eliminate or do less of is spending too much time on social media. To make the cue invisible, I can remove social media apps from my phone and turn off notifications. To make the process unattractive, I can focus on the negative consequences of spending too much time on social media, such as decreased productivity and increased anxiety. To make the response unsatisfying, I can set a time limit for social media use and stick to it.
